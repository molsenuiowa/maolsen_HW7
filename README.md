# Business Analytics Student Survey
Description

This project is a web-based survey designed to gather feedback from students about their experience in the Business Analytics program. Through a series of questions spread over multiple pages, it collects data on students' backgrounds, their impressions of the program, and specific coursework completed.

Best Practices for Forms

We employed clear and descriptive labels for all form inputs, making it straightforward for users to understand what information is required. Each label is directly associated with its corresponding input field, enhancing form usability and accessibility. To improve user interaction, we implemented field focus, where the first input field on each form page automatically gains focus, aiding in navigation, especially for keyboard users.

Validation techniques were applied to ensure that all required fields are completed with appropriate data before submission. For fields such as the "Hometown" and "Impression of the major," we used dropdowns with predefined options to minimize user errors and standardize the responses for easier analysis.

Accessibility

Accessibility was a cornerstone of our development process, ensuring that our web forms are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. We adhered to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, achieving at least Level AA compliance. This was accomplished by using semantic HTML5 elements, such as <form>, <input>, <select>, and <button>, which provide inherent accessibility features.
